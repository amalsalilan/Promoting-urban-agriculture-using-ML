We can estimate how many trees and plants we can fit into the available spaces in our home or office by utilising this approach. The primary goal of this initiative is to increase the amount of oxygen produced by plants that have been harvested from forests to make way for structures.
On this data set, I tested various machine learning regressors.
There are some issues with the data set because we developed the dataset for this project, however the project is only 70% complete at this point.
